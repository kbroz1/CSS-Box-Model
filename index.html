        When Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) becomes ill, his son, William (Billy Crudup), travels to be with him. William
        has a strained relationship with Edward because his father has always told exaggerated stories about his life,
        and William thinks he's never really told the truth. Even on his deathbed, Edward recounts fantastical
        anecdotes. When William, who is a journalist, starts to investigate his father's tales, he begins to understand
        the man and his penchant for storytelling.
